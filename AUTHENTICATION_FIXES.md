# Authentication Fixes

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. Password Validation Error (400)

```
"Password must be at least 8 characters long and include uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character."
```

- Frontend validation was only requiring 6 characters
- Backend requires 8+ characters with complexity

### 2. Auth Token Storage Error

```
ERROR Error saving auth token: [Error: [AsyncStorage] Passing null/undefined as value is not supported]
```

- `setAuthToken` was trying to store `undefined` values
- Signup response doesn't include auth token (needs verification)

### 3. Duplicate Signup Attempt (409)

```
Error status: 409
```

- User already exists in the system

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Password Validation (`app/(auth)/signup.tsx`)

```typescript
password: yup
  .string()
  .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
  .matches(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/,
    "Password must include uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character")
  .required("Password is required"),
```

### 2. Fixed Auth Token Storage (`api/config.ts`)

```typescript
export const setAuthToken = async (
  token: string | null | undefined
): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    if (token) {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem("authToken", token);
      console.log("Auth token saved successfully");
    } else {
      console.log("No auth token provided, skipping storage");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving auth token:", error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Improved Signup Flow (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

```typescript
// Check if signup was successful but account needs verification
if (authResponse && authResponse.authToken) {
  // Set user and token for immediate login
  // ... set user data and token
} else {
  // Account created but needs verification
  console.log("Account created successfully, verification required");
  // Don't set user or token since verification is needed
}
```

## Current Authentication Flow

### âœ… Working Features:

- **Backend Server**: Now responding (200 status)
- **Signup Endpoint**: Working correctly
- **Password Validation**: Matches backend requirements
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of undefined tokens
- **Mock Fallback**: Still available for network errors

### ðŸ”„ Signup Process:

1. **User enters valid credentials** (8+ chars, complexity)
2. **Backend creates account** (200 response)
3. **Account needs verification** (no immediate login)
4. **User should verify email** before login

### ðŸ”„ Login Process:

1. **User enters credentials**
2. **Backend validates** (if account verified)
3. **Returns auth token** (if successful)
4. **App stores token** and user data

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Signup with Valid Password:

```
Email: test@example.com
Password: ValidPass123!
Username: testuser
Full Name: Test User
```

- Should show "Account creation successful, verify account to login"
- Should NOT immediately log in (verification required)

### 2. Test Signup with Invalid Password:

```
Password: weak
```

- Should show validation error: "Password must include uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character"

### 3. Test Duplicate Signup:

- Try signing up with same email again
- Should show 409 error (user already exists)

### 4. Test Login (after verification):

```
Email: eaaboagye25@gmail.com
Password: NewP@ssword123
```

- Should work if account is verified
- Should store auth token properly

## Backend Requirements

### Password Policy:

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include uppercase letter
- Must include lowercase letter
- Must include digit
- Must include special character (@$!%\*?&)

### Account Verification:

- Signup creates account but doesn't log in
- Email verification required before login
- OTP verification process available

## Next Steps

### For Users:

1. **Use strong passwords** - Follow the new validation rules
2. **Check email** - Verify account after signup
3. **Try login** - After verification is complete

### For Development:

1. **Test all scenarios** - Valid/invalid passwords, duplicate signups
2. **Monitor logs** - Check for any remaining errors
3. **Verify flow** - Ensure signup â†’ verification â†’ login works

### For Backend Team:

1. **Email verification** - Ensure verification emails are sent
2. **Login endpoint** - Verify it works after account verification
3. **Error messages** - Ensure clear feedback for users

## Debug Information

The app now includes comprehensive logging:

- Password validation errors
- Auth token storage attempts
- Signup response handling
- Network error fallbacks

All authentication flows should now work correctly with proper error handling.
