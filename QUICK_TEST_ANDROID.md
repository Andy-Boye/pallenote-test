# Quick Test: Android Device

## Test Microphone on Android First

Since the iOS `NSOSStatusErrorDomain` error is specific to Expo Go on iOS, you can test the microphone functionality on an Android device to verify your code works.

### Steps:

1. **Install Expo Go on Android**
   - Download from Google Play Store
   - Or use the same QR code

2. **Test the Microphone**
   - Open your app on Android
   - Try the "Test Microphone" button
   - It should work without the iOS error

3. **Verify Code Works**
   - If it works on Android, your code is correct
   - The issue is specifically Expo Go + iOS limitations

### Expected Result on Android:
✅ Microphone test should work  
✅ Recording should start successfully  
✅ No `NSOSStatusErrorDomain` error  

### If Android Also Fails:
- Check microphone permissions
- Close other audio apps
- Restart Expo Go

**This confirms the issue is Expo Go + iOS specific, not your code.**
