# Notebook-Note Association Fix

## âœ… **Problem Solved**

The system now properly ensures that **notes created and saved in a specific notebook are accessible when that notebook is selected** in the notebook screen.

## ðŸ”§ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Mock Data Filtering** (`api/notesApi.ts`)

- âœ… **Before**: Mock data was not properly filtered by `notebookId`
- âœ… **After**: Mock data is correctly filtered when `notebookId` parameter is provided
- âœ… **Result**: Notes appear in the correct notebook when viewing notebook details

### 2. **Enhanced Basic Note Creation** (`app/notes/new.tsx`)

- âœ… **Before**: Hardcoded to `notebookId: 'default'`
- âœ… **After**: Added notebook selector dropdown
- âœ… **Result**: Users can choose which notebook to save notes in

### 3. **Improved Notebook Detail Screen** (`app/notebooks/[notebookId]/[index].tsx`)

- âœ… **Before**: Notes created in notebook context weren't properly associated
- âœ… **After**: Notes are automatically assigned to current notebook
- âœ… **Result**: Notes created from within a notebook stay in that notebook

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

### **Note Creation Flow:**

1. **User selects notebook** â†’ Notebook ID is captured
2. **User creates note** â†’ Note is saved with correct `notebookId`
3. **API stores note** â†’ Note is associated with selected notebook
4. **User views notebook** â†’ Only notes from that notebook are displayed

### **Mock Data Structure:**

```typescript
// Notes are properly distributed across notebooks
const mockNotes = [
  { id: "1", title: "Welcome Note", notebookId: "default" },
  { id: "2", title: "Getting Started", notebookId: "default" },
  { id: "3", title: "Meeting Notes", notebookId: "work" },
  { id: "4", title: "Ideas for App", notebookId: "ideas" },
  { id: "5", title: "Shopping List", notebookId: "personal" },
  { id: "6", title: "Travel Plans", notebookId: "personal" },
  { id: "7", title: "Reading List", notebookId: "ideas" },
];
```
