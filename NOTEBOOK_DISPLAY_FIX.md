# Notebook Display Fix

## Issue

When pressing on a notebook, it wasn't displaying the notes in it.

## Root Cause

1. **Missing Default Notebook**: The mock data didn't include a "default" notebook
2. **No Notes in Default**: There were no notes assigned to the "default" notebook
3. **Filtering Logic**: The filtering was working but there was no data to show

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Default Notebook (`api/notebooksApi.ts`)

```typescript
// Added to mock notebooks array
{
  id: 'default',
  title: 'My Notebook',
  ownerId: userId,
  isDefault: true,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

### 2. Added Notes to Default Notebook (`api/notesApi.ts`)

```typescript
// Added welcome notes to default notebook
{
  id: '1',
  title: 'Welcome Note',
  content: 'Welcome to Pallenote! This is your default notebook...',
  notebookId: 'default',
  userId: userId
},
{
  id: '2',
  title: 'Getting Started',
  content: 'Here are some tips to get started...',
  notebookId: 'default',
  userId: userId
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

- Added detailed logging to track filtering process
- Added logging to show which notes are being returned
- Added logging to show notebook navigation

## Current Mock Data Structure

### Notebooks:

- `default` - "My Notebook" (2 notes)
- `work` - "Work Notes" (1 note)
- `personal` - "Personal Notes" (2 notes)
- `ideas` - "Ideas & Projects" (2 notes)

### Notes Distribution:

- **Default Notebook**: Welcome Note, Getting Started
- **Work Notebook**: Meeting Notes
- **Personal Notebook**: Shopping List, Travel Plans
- **Ideas Notebook**: Ideas for App, Reading List

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Default Notebook

1. Click on "My Notebook"
2. Should see 2 notes: "Welcome Note" and "Getting Started"

### Test 2: Work Notebook

1. Click on "Work Notes"
2. Should see 1 note: "Meeting Notes"

### Test 3: Personal Notebook

1. Click on "Personal Notes"
2. Should see 2 notes: "Shopping List" and "Travel Plans"

### Test 4: Ideas Notebook

1. Click on "Ideas & Projects"
2. Should see 2 notes: "Ideas for App" and "Reading List"

## Debug Information

The app now includes detailed logging to help track:

- Which notebook is being opened
- What notes are available before filtering
- What notes are returned after filtering
- The final notes count and details

## Expected Behavior

When you click on any notebook, you should now see:

1. The notebook title in the header
2. The correct number of notes in the subtitle
3. The filtered list of notes for that specific notebook
4. A floating action button to add new notes to that notebook

## If Still Not Working

Check the console logs for:

- `Filtering notes by notebookId: [notebook-id]`
- `Available notes before filtering: [...]`
- `Filtered notes result: [...]`
- `Notes count: [number]`

This will help identify if the issue is with:

- Navigation (wrong notebookId being passed)
- Filtering (notes not matching the notebookId)
- UI rendering (notes not being displayed)
