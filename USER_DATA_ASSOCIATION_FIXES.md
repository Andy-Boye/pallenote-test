# User Data Association & Notebook Filtering Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Notes not appearing in assigned notebooks** - Notes were being created but not properly filtered by notebook
2. **Notes and notebooks not being saved for the logged-in user** - No user association was being handled

## Fixes Applied

### 1. User ID Management (`api/config.ts`)

- ✅ Added `getCurrentUserId()` helper function to retrieve user ID from AsyncStorage
- ✅ Uses user ID or email as fallback for user identification

### 2. Notes API Enhancements (`api/notesApi.ts`)

- ✅ **User Association**: All note creation now includes `userId` field
- ✅ **Notebook Filtering**: `getNotes()` now properly filters by `notebookId` parameter
- ✅ **Mock Data**: Updated mock data to show proper notebook assignments:
  - Meeting Notes → Work notebook
  - Ideas for App → Ideas notebook
  - Shopping List → Personal notebook
  - Travel Plans → Personal notebook
  - Reading List → Ideas notebook

### 3. Notebooks API Enhancements (`api/notebooksApi.ts`)

- ✅ **User Association**: All notebook operations now include `ownerId` field
- ✅ **User Filtering**: `getNotebooks()` filters by current user
- ✅ **Mock Data**: Updated mock data to include proper user ownership

### 4. UI Improvements (`app/notebooks/[notebookId]/[index].tsx`)

- ✅ **Efficient Filtering**: Notes are now filtered at the API level instead of client-side
- ✅ **Better Data Flow**: Direct notebook-specific note fetching
- ✅ **User Context**: Proper handling of user-specific data

## How It Works Now

### Note Creation Flow:

1. User creates note in specific notebook
2. `createNote()` adds `userId` to note data
3. Note is saved with user association
4. Note appears only in the assigned notebook

### Notebook Filtering Flow:

1. User navigates to notebook
2. `getNotes({ notebookId })` fetches only notes for that notebook
3. API filters by both `notebookId` and `userId`
4. UI displays only relevant notes

### User Data Isolation:

1. All API calls include user ID from AsyncStorage
2. Mock data is user-specific
3. Notes and notebooks are properly associated with logged-in user

## Testing the Fixes

### To verify notes appear in correct notebooks:

1. Create a note in "Work Notes" notebook
2. Navigate to "Work Notes" - note should appear
3. Navigate to "Personal Notes" - note should NOT appear
4. Create note in "Personal Notes" - should only appear there

### To verify user data isolation:

1. Log in as User A
2. Create notes and notebooks
3. Log out and log in as User B
4. User B should see different/empty data

## Mock Data Structure

```typescript
// Notes with proper notebook assignments
const mockNotes = [
  { id: "1", title: "Meeting Notes", notebookId: "work", userId: "user123" },
  { id: "2", title: "Ideas for App", notebookId: "ideas", userId: "user123" },
  {
    id: "3",
    title: "Shopping List",
    notebookId: "personal",
    userId: "user123",
  },
  // ...
];

// Notebooks with user ownership
const mockNotebooks = [
  { id: "work", title: "Work Notes", ownerId: "user123" },
  { id: "personal", title: "Personal Notes", ownerId: "user123" },
  { id: "ideas", title: "Ideas & Projects", ownerId: "user123" },
];
```

## Backend Requirements

For the backend to work properly, it should:

1. Accept `userId` parameter in note queries
2. Accept `ownerId` parameter in notebook queries
3. Store `userId` with each note
4. Store `ownerId` with each notebook
5. Filter results by user ID

## Current Status

- ✅ **Frontend**: Fully implemented with user association
- ✅ **Mock Data**: Properly structured with user and notebook relationships
- ✅ **UI**: Correctly filters and displays notebook-specific notes
- ⚠️ **Backend**: Needs to implement user filtering (currently returns 404/405 errors)

The app now properly handles user data isolation and notebook filtering, even with backend API issues, thanks to comprehensive mock data implementation.
